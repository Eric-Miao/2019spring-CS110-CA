s1:
hit rate 0
step size 8=2^3, which is 32 bytes per access, how ever we only have 32 bytes 
cache, thus every time is a miss.


two sw determines the hit rate

Q1: block size & # of blocks & repcount & stepsize (in terms of fixed array size)
Q2: 0.5, the same in each repcount loop 
Q3: increase the stepsize to 128 and increase the repcount as many as possible

s2:
hit rate 0.75
step size = 2
